# Foobar_Solutions
Solutions to the questions I've solved so far on the Foobar Portal ( http://foobar.iiitd.edu.in/contest/team/ )

These solutions are only for reference and shouldn't be used as it is for solving the corresponding problems on the portal.
Instead, try to understand and solve the question and if you get stuck at the implementation part at some point, you may refer to
these codes. However,don't forgot to add a link to solution as 'reference' (as a comment).
